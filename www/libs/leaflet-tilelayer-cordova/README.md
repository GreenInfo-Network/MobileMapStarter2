# L.TileLayer.Cordova

Leaflet TileLayer subclass which caches to local filesystem, for Cordova/Phonegap

Includes a [test/demo](https://github.com/gregallensworth/L.TileLayer.Cordova/tree/master/test) application for Cordova/Phonegap, walking through the basics. See its own README file.

# Usage

See [test/www/](https://github.com/gregallensworth/L.TileLayer.Cordova/tree/master/test/www) for a functional application as well as JavaScript source code.

A basic example as as follows:

```js
    BASE = L.tileLayerCordova('http://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
        // these options are perfectly ordinary L.TileLayer options
        maxZoom: 18,
        attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright/">OpenStreetMap contributors</a>',
        // these are specific to L.TileLayer.Cordova and mostly specify where to store the tiles on disk
        folder: 'LTileLayerCordovaExample',
        name:   'example',
        debug:   true
    }).addTo(MAP);

    // calculate a tile pyramid starting at a lat/lon and going down to a stated range of zoom levels
    var tile_list = BASE.calculateXYZListFromPyramid(LAT, LNG, CACHE_ZOOM_MIN, CACHE_ZOOM_MAX);
    BASE.downloadXYZList(
        // 1st param: a list of XYZ objects indicating tiles to download
        tile_list,
        // 2nd param: overwrite existing tiles on disk?
        // if no then a tile already on disk will be kept, which can be a big time saver
        true,
        // 3rd param: progress callback
        // receives the number of tiles downloaded and the number of tiles total
        // caller can calculate a percentage, update progress bar, etc.
        function (done,total) {
            var percent = Math.round(100 * done / total);
            status_block.innerHTML = done  + " / " + total + " = " + percent + "%";
        },
        // 4th param: complete callback
        // no parameters are given, but we know we're done!
        function () {
            // for this demo, on success we use another L.TileLayer.Cordova feature and show the disk usage!
            BASE.getDiskUsage(function (filecount,bytes) {
                var kilobytes = Math.round( bytes / 1024 );
                status_block.innerHTML = "Done" + "<br/>" + filecount + " files" + "<br/>" + kilobytes + " kB";
            });
        },
        // 5th param: error callback
        // parameter is the error message string
        function (error) {
            alert("Failed\nError code: " + error.code);
        }
    );
```

When running under Cordova/Phonegap this tile layer will behave much as usual, but has special behaviors such as the ability to cache sets of tiles, then to switch between "online mode" and "offline mode"

# Constructor and Options

In Leaflet tradition, there is a constructor for use with _new_ and also a utility function. They have an identical outcome:
    var layer = new L.TileLayer.Cordova(url,options)
    var layer = L.tileLayerCordova(url,options)

Most options are passed through to L.TileLayer and will be supported as is typical. This would include `maxZoom`, attributions, TMS, the `{x}{y}{z}{s}` markups in the IURL template, and so on.
In addition, these config options are supported:
* *folder* -- REQUIRED. A folder path under which tiles are stored. The name of your app may be good, e.g. "My Trail App" See the _Cache Folders and TileLayer Names_ section for more information.
* *name* -- REQUIRED. A unique name for this TileLayer, for naming the tiles and then fetching them later. Keep it brief, e.g. "terrain" See the _Cache Folders and TileLayer Names_ section for more information.
* *debug* -- If true (defaults to false), extra console.log() calls are made to show progress and debugging.

The constructor and utility function both support an optional success_callback.  This will be called when all time-intensive filesystem activity is complete.  Useful if you want to update a status indicator when the tilelayer has finished initializing.  For example, if you want to call getDiskUsage() immediately in order to display the info to the user, that method should be called within this success_callback.

# Cache Folders and TileLayer Names

*Multiple L.TileLayer.Cordova instances may share the same folder.* Cache management such as emptyCache() and getDiskUsage() are keyed by the folder, so it's important to understand these interactions.

* The _folder_ indicates where L.TileLayer.Cordova will store its files, e.g. "My Trail Finder" becomes _/pathto/sdcard/My Trail Finder_
* The _name_ is used to cue the filename, e.g. terrain-12-34-56.png

Multiple L.TileLayer.Cordova instances may share the same _folder_, albeit with different _name_ settings. In this scenario, calling getDiskUsage() on either layer would report a pooled usage... and calling emptyCache() on either layer would empty tiles for both layers. Thus, the specific wording in the documentation for those methods about _the cache folder_.

This is for the best: a typical use case would have all of your tiles in one folder, and you would want to view _total_ usage and empty the _entire_ cache for your application -- preferably without writing callback-within-callback to iterate over every layer in your app.

If you want your two layers to be separate, with separate usage counts and separate emptyCache() behaviors, then assign them to separate folders.

# Methods - Toggling State

- `goOffline()`
Set the layer to offline mode. This sets the URL pattern to load tiles from the offline on-device cache. Online tiles will no longer be used. Naturally, this is most effective if you have in fact cached any tiles.

- `goOnline()`
Set the layer to online mode. This sets the URL pattern to load tiles from the HTTP service indicated in your URL string. On-device offline tiles will no longer be used.

# Methods - Determining State

- `isOnline()`
Returns true if the map is online, false otherwise.

- `isOffline()`
Returns true if the map is offline, false otherwise.

# Methods - Caching and Calculations

Much of this is based on the concept of _xyz objects_ An XYZ object is simply a JavaScript object with the attributes `x`, `y`, and `z` used to describe the ordinates of a tile. Combined with the layer's URL template you provided in the constructor, or with the offline filesystem URL generated internally, an XYZ can be used to cmpose the URL of a specific tile in both offline state and online state.

- `downloadAndStoreTile(x,y,z,success_callback,error_callback)`
Given the XYZ ordinates of one single tile, download this one tile and store it into the offline cache. This method forms the basis of other download wrappers.
The _success_callback_ is called if it worked out. No parameters are given.
The _error_callback_ will be called if it failed. This callback is passed one parameter: an error message string.

- `downloadXYZList(xyzlist,overwrite,progress_callback,complete_callback,error_callback)`
Given a list of _xyz objects_ representing tile ordinates, download all of these tiles and save them to the on-device cache.
The _overwrite_ flag specifies whether tiles already in the on-device cache will be skipped and retained or else downloaded and overwritten. Setting overwrite to false can be a big time-saver, if someone has already cached an overlapping area.
The _progress_callback_ is called as each tile is downloaded and saved. The callback is passed two parameters: the number of tiles now comlpeted (integer) and the number of tiles to be downloaded (integer). This is suitable for displaying a progress bar, for example.
The _complete_callback_ is called when all tiles have been downloaded and saved. It is passed no parameters. This would be suitable for supressing a progress message, or displaying a Done! message, for example.
The _error_callback_ is called in the event of an error. It is passed one parameter: an error message string.

- `calculateXYZListFromPyramid(lat,lon,zmin,zmax)`
Given a `latitude` and `longitude`, calculate the tile which contains it. Then, for the (inclusive) range of zoom levels `zmin` through `zmax` calculate the pyramid downward.
The return is a list of _xyz objects_ suitable for use with downloadXYZList()

- `calculateXYZListFromBounds(bounds,zmin,zmax)`
Given a bounds object (like that obtained by calling MAP.getBounds()), return a list of all tiles required to make up that map area (including multiple zoom levels, if specified).

# Methods - Cache Management

See also: [Cache Folders and TileLayer Names](https://github.com/gregallensworth/L.TileLayer.Cordova#cachefoldersandtileLayernames)

- `getDiskUsage(usage_callback)`
Calculate the disk usage of all files in the layer's cache folder. The _usage_callback_ is passed two parameters: The count of files, and the count of bytes.
NOTE: This tallies up all tiles in the cache folder, not necessarily those belonging solely to this specific L.TileLayer.Cordova instance. See the section about Cache Folders and TileLayer Names.

- `emptyCache(done_callback)`
Delete all of the files in the layer's cache folder. The _done_callback_ is called with two parameters: integer count of the number of files deleted, and integer count of the number of files where deletion failed.
NOTE: This deletes all tiles in the cache folder, not necessarily those belonging solely to this specific L.TileLayer.Cordova instance. See the section about Cache Folders and TileLayer Names.

- `getCacheContents(done_callback)`
Calls done_callback with an array representing the cache contents.  Useful if you want to build some sort of cache navigator for your UI.
